For some reason after running `apt-get upgrades`, and maybe a few other things happened in between, on my installation of Kubuntu 15.04, KDE had stopped working the way it should. It started with a crash and the screen turned black. Visible was only the mouse cursor which I could move, and IM Contacts which I could move too. Unfortunately I was unable to start any other program from within it, there was no panel, nor could I Alt+F2 to open anything through a command.

After looking around, and installing a whole bunch of other Desktop Environments (DE) which for the most part had other issues I didn't like, I managed to fix it.

By removing everything in `~/.cache/` and `~/.kde/`, you basically are cleaning up and starting fresh. A reboot and it worked for me.

Note: well, not completely, in between I also purged my kubuntu-desktop with `apt-get purge kubuntu-desktop` and reinstalled `apt-get install --no-install-recommends kubuntu-desktop`, but I question if this was necessary at all.

# Irssi or Weechat shortcut for switching windows `alt+#` does not work in Unity/Gnome
Issue is gnome-terminal has shortcuts which use the same combination to switch between terminal tabs. By disabling these, your commands will pass through to irssi/weechat and they will work properly. `Edit-> Preferences`, navigate to `shortcuts` tab and locate `Switch to Tab %d`, [1~10]. Clicking on the shortcut and hitting `backspace` will disable the shortcut.
