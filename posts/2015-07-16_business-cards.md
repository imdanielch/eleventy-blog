Well, for what it's worth, I have finished my design for my business cards. I plan on using these when I'm at [TXLF](https://texaslinuxfest.org/). Without further ado, here they are!

(almost 1:1 scale!, only smaller since I saved bleed area)

If you have any comments and critiques, I'm all ears! leave a comment below or catch me on twitter [@imdanielch](http://twitter.com/imdanielch). Hope you like them :D
