While at work we all have some break time where we have to wait for something to happen or complete. There's also time where we deal with such mundane tasks which require minimal brain power and our eyes wander to the clock to realize how torpid the minute arm is.

In my case, my current tasks require minimal brain usage throughout most of the day and with a few short breaks which do not lend me enough time to do anything worthwhile. I had wondered what to do with my time besides just listening to music while working. Music is good, but after a while I felt that it was time wasted. This is where I turned to podcasts. They are free and you can subscribe to many different topics from science to short stories or comedy. Anyways, here are the ones I listen to.

####Stories:
* [This American Life (always interesting)](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast)
* [Selected Shorts](http://www.selectedshorts.org/podcast/)
* [The Moth Podcast](http://themoth.org/about/programs/the-moth-podcast)

####Technology:
* [Javascript Jabber](http://javascriptjabber.com/)
* [Security Now](http://twit.tv/sn)
* [The Linux Action Show(a bit infomertial)](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/linuxactionshow/)
* [This Week in Tech](http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech)
####Science:
* [Radiolab from WNYC (I love this one)](http://www.radiolab.org/series/podcasts/)
####Education:
* [Manager Tools](http://www.manager-tools.com/podcast/manager-tools)
* [Stuff You Should Know](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/)
* [I Love Marketing (haven't been following it in a long time, but I'm guessing it's still good)](http://ilovemarketing.com/category/podcast/)
####Other:
* [The Alton Browncast (food related info or interviews)](https://www.nerdist.com/podcast/the-browncast/)
* [The Joe Rogan Experience(NSFW)](http://podcasts.joerogan.net/)

Besides podcasts, I also do the typical internet browsing for killing time: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and E-mail.

One issue with listening podcasts constantly is that you end up with what I'd call occupational fatigue. After listening to the podcasts all day long, by the end of the day I don't want to do anything related to things I listened to.
